# Epileptic Seizure Detection using Machine Learning

## Abstract

Epilepsy, a neurological disorder affecting millions globally, presents a significant challenge in predicting seizures, often leading to adverse outcomes and diminished quality of life for patients. This article explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving seizure prediction, thereby enhancing patient outcomes. By employing machine learning (ML) models such as k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes classifiers, we investigate the efficacy of forecasting epileptic seizures, offering valuable insights for clinicians and caregivers. Leveraging electroencephalogram (EEG) data to capture brain activity, AI-powered approaches show promise in revolutionizing epilepsy management. The study demonstrates the transformative impact of AI in seizure prediction, contributing to better patient care.

## Introduction

### General Context

Epileptic seizures, characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, pose a significant health concern globally, affecting millions of individuals across diverse demographics. Timely detection and prediction of seizures are critical for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) algorithms offer a novel approach to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data, providing insights into seizure dynamics and facilitating proactive interventions.

### Problematic

Despite advancements in medical technology, accurately predicting epileptic seizures remains challenging due to their unpredictable nature and complex neurological mechanisms. Current diagnostic methods often rely on subjective assessments or limited biomarkers, leading to suboptimal outcomes for patients. There is a pressing need for innovative strategies that leverage AI and ML to develop accurate and clinically relevant seizure prediction models.

### Critical Statement and Objectives

This article presents three ML models trained and tested for epileptic seizure prediction using the Epileptic Seizure Recognition Dataset. By addressing methodological considerations and evaluating model performance, the study aims to enhance the reliability and utility of ML-driven approaches in seizure prediction. The objectives include:
